# Preface

I initially wrote this tool because during the process of learning `pwn`, I often had to repeatedly comment and uncomment statements like `gdb.attach(xxx)`, constantly modify scripts when setting different breakpoints, and also needed to modify scripts when switching from local debugging to remote exploitation.

After getting used to command-line operations, I wondered if I could design a command-line tool that could control certain things through command-line parameters, avoiding the repetitive execution of the above tasks when debugging `pwn` challenges and focusing only on writing exploit scripts. When the idea took shape, I tried to write the first line of code, and thus, `pwncli` was born.

The purpose of a tool is practicality. I believe `pwncli` meets the practicality requirements and can save a lot of time when debugging `pwn` challenges.

If you find `pwncli` useful, please introduce it to fellow `pwners` around you. If you have any questions, please submit an `issue` or contact me at `roderickchan@foxmail.com`, I would be very happy to discuss and communicate with you. If you have good ideas or discover new bugs, feel free to submit `pull requests`.

# Introduction
[EN](https://github.com/RoderickChan/pwncli/blob/main/README-EN.md) | [ZH](https://github.com/RoderickChan/pwncli/blob/main/README.md) | [API](https://github.com/RoderickChan/pwncli/blob/main/API-DOC.md) | [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFemxI3rnC8)

`pwncli` is a simple and easy-to-use `pwn` challenge debugging and exploitation tool that can improve your speed and efficiency in debugging `pwn` challenge scripts during CTF competitions.

`pwncli` can help you quickly write `pwn` challenge exploitation scripts and achieve convenient switching between local debugging and remote exploitation. `pwncli` supports three usage modes:
- Command line usage mode
- In-script usage mode
- Library import usage mode

The above three modes are referred to as: command line mode, script mode, and library mode, respectively. Among them, command line mode works the same way as other command line tools (such as `ls`, `tar` commands under `linux`), and can be used for local interactive debugging; script mode can wrap your own Python exploitation scripts into command line tools, then call subcommands to execute the required functions; library mode only calls some convenient utility functions to facilitate quick problem solving.

The following usage mode sections will detail the usage methods and techniques of the three modes.

`pwncli` is designed in a main command-subcommand pattern (similar to `git`), and currently has the following (sub)commands:
```
pwncli
    config
        list
        set
    debug
    misc
        gadget
        setgdb
    patchelf
    qemu
    remote
```
Where `pwncli` is the main command, `config/debug/misc/patchelf/qemu/remote` are first-level subcommands, `list/set` are second-level subcommands under `config`, and `gadget/setgdb` are second-level subcommands under `misc`.

`pwncli` supports command prefix matching (similar to `gdb`'s command prefix matching). Usually, you only need to provide the command prefix to successfully call the command. That is, entering `pwncli debug ./pwn`, `pwncli de ./pwn`, and `pwncli d ./pwn` have exactly the same execution effect. However, you must ensure that the prefix does not match two or more subcommands, otherwise a `MatchError` matching error will be thrown.

`pwncli` is extremely easy to extend. You only need to add `cmd_xxx.py` in the `pwncli/commands` directory and write your own subcommand. `pwncli` will automatically detect and load the subcommand. For example, if you want to add a `magic` command, you only need to:
```
1. Add a cmd_magic.py file in the pwncli/commands directory
2. Write the command execution logic in cmd_magic.py
```
When you need to remove the command, you can delete the `cmd_magic` file or rename it to something that doesn't start with `cmd_`.

`pwncli` depends on [click](https://github.com/pallets/click) and [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools). The former is an excellent command line writing tool, and the latter is an exploitation library commonly used by `pwners`.

The advantages of `pwncli` can be summarized as:
- Write the script once, use command line to control local debugging and remote exploitation
- Convenient for setting breakpoints and executing other `gdb` commands during debugging
- Easy to extend and customize subcommands
- Many useful built-in commands and functions

# Installation
`pwncli` can be used on both `linux` and `windows`, but usage on `windows` is severely limited, such as the `debug` command being unavailable and the `remote` command being only partially usable. `pwncli` can only be used in a `python3` environment, and compatibility with `python2` is not currently being considered.

It is recommended to use `pwncli` on `ubuntu` systems. In particular, if you understand `WSL` and choose to use `WSL` to solve `pwn` challenges, `pwncli + WSL` would be an excellent choice. The `debug` subcommand has many practical parameters designed for `WSL` systems and implements some interesting features.

If you choose to use `WSL`, please try to ensure that the distribution name is the default `Ubuntu-16.04/Ubuntu-18.04/Ubuntu-20.04/Ubuntu-22.04`. Some options of the `debug` command are closely tied to the default distribution names.

There are two installation methods for `pwncli`. The first is local installation (**strongly recommended**):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RoderickChan/pwncli.git
cd ./pwncli
pip3 install --editable .
```
After installation, don't forget to add the path where `pwncli` is located to the `PATH` environment variable, which is generally `~/.local/bin`. You can add `export PATH=$PATH:/home/xxx/.local/bin` to the `.bashrc/.zshrc` file in your home directory.

The advantage of this installation method is: when you need to keep `pwncli` updated, you only need to execute `git pull` to use the latest version of `pwncli`.

The second installation method is using `pip3`:
```
pip3 install pwncli
```
The `pwncli` installed this way may not be the latest version and may encounter some already resolved bugs. But please trust me, I will promptly update `pwncli` to `pypi`.

After installation, execute `pwncli --version`. Seeing the version information output indicates successful installation.

# Usage Modes
## Command Line Mode
You can treat `pwncli` as a command line tool, although it is essentially a `python` script. Using `pwncli -h` or `pwncli --help` will get you the command line usage guide. If you want to get the usage guide for a specific subcommand, such as the `debug` command, just enter `pwncli debug -h`.

## Script Mode
In addition to using `pwncli` as a command line tool, you can also wrap your script into a command line tool, and then use this script just like using `pwncli`.
Using script mode is very simple. If your exploitation script is `exp.py`, write in the script:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwncli import *

cli_script() # This function must be called to use script mode
```

Then, entering `python3 exp.py -h` on the command line will give you the same output as `pwncli -h` in command line mode. In particular, if you specify the interpreter path in the first line of the script, you can enter `./exp.py -h` without explicitly typing `python3`.

After that, you can treat `exp.py` as `pwncli` and use all the commands and features that `pwncli` has.

Of course, you can enrich your script to achieve more functionality. When using the `debug` and `remote` commands, you can continue adding to the script:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwncli import *

cli_script() # This function must be explicitly called to use script mode

# You can get many things from gift
io   = gift['io'] # process or remote object
elf  = gift["elf"] # ELF object, ELF("./pwn")
libc = gift.libc # ELF object, ELF("./libc.so.6")

filename  = gift.filename # current filename
is_debug  = gift.debug # is debug or not 
is_remote = gift.remote # is remote or not
gdb_pid   = gift.gdb_pid # gdb pid if debug

# Sometimes the libc provided remotely is different from the local one, replace libc with remote libc when attacking
if gift.remote:
    libc = ELF("./libc.so.6")
    gift['libc'] = libc

# Write exploitation functions here
# ......
io.interactive() # Keep interactive with socket
```
Those familiar with `pwntools` will definitely not be unfamiliar with the above script. Essentially, calling `cli_script()` will parse command line parameters and then place some useful data in `gift`. For example, you can retrieve `io`, which is the `process` or `remote` object from the `pwntools` module, and interact with it.

## Library Mode
Library mode, as the name suggests, is suitable for scenarios where you only need to use some functions or features of `pwncli` without parsing command line parameters. You can use `pwncli` like any other `python` library, for example, write in a script:

```python
from pwncli import *

# Write other script content here
# You can use the interfaces provided in pwncli
context.arch="amd64"
io = process("./pwn")

# If you need to search for libc version and other functions based on offset
# This feature is similar to LibcSearcher but doesn't require local installation, needs internet connection
libc_box = LibcBox()
libc_box.add_symbol("system", 0x640)
libc_box.add_symbol("puts", 0x810)
libc_box.search(download_symbols=False, download_so=False, download_deb=True) # Whether to download locally
read_offset = libc_box.dump("read")

# Get the libc base address of a program by pid
res = get_segment_base_addr_by_proc_maps(pid=10150)
libc_base = res['libc']
heap_base = get_current_heapbase_addr() # Only for local debugging

# Get shellcode
cat_flag = ShellcodeMall.amd64.cat_flag
reverse_tcp = ShellcodeMall.amd64.reverse_tcp_connect(ip="127.0.0.1", port=10001)

# Use some convenient decorators
# Sleep before calling this function
@sleep_call_before(1)
def add():
    pass

# If this function doesn't finish running within 10s, it will throw an exception
@bomber(10)
def del_():
  pass

# API is no longer used
@unused()
def wtf():
  pass

# Search for gadgets
ropper_box = RopperBox()
ropper_box.add_file("libc", "libc.so.6", arch=RopperArchType.x86_64)
pop_rdi_ret = ropper_box.get_pop_rdi_ret()
leav_ret = ropper_box.search_gadget("leave; ret")

# Construct IO_FILE structure
fake_file = IO_FILE_plus_struct()
fake_file.flags = 0xfbad1887
fake_file._mode = 1
fake_file.vtable = 0xdeadbeef
payload = bytes(fake_file)

# Replace payload
payload = "aaaabbbbcccc"
new_payload = payload_replace(payload, {4: "eeee"}) # aaaaeeeecccc

# Get gadgets from currently loaded libc
all_ogs = get_current_one_gadget_from_libc()

# Wrap common io operation functions
# sendline
sl("data")
# sendafter
sa("\n", "data")

# Use current gadgets directly
CurrentGadgets.set_find_area(find_in_elf=True, find_in_libc=False, do_initial=False)

pop_rdi_ret = CurrentGadgets.pop_rdi_ret()

execve_chain = CurrentGadgets.execve_chain(bin_sh_addr=0x11223344)

# There are many other practical interfaces in pwncli
# ......

io.interactive()
```

It's not hard to see that the difference between library mode and command mode usage: just remove `cli_script()`. Note that scripts in library mode are just ordinary `python` scripts and cannot parse command line parameters.

The following is a simple text tutorial.

Before using `pwncli`, it is recommended to master the basic commands of `gdb/tmux` and ensure that you have installed one or more plugins such as `pwndbg/gef/peda`.

Taking the `debug` command in script mode as an example (this is also the most commonly used mode and command).

First enter the `tmux` environment, use `tmux new -s xxx` to enter.

Then write in the script `exp.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-

from pwncli import *

# use script mode
cli_script()

# get use for obj from gift
io: tube = gift['io'] 
elf: ELF = gift['elf']
libc: ELF = gift['libc']

ia()
```

Then grant the script execution permission, and enter `./exp.py de ./pwn -t` to see the `tmux` debugging window opened.

For programs without `PIE`, the way to set breakpoints is:

```shell
./exp.py de ./pwn -t -b 0x400088a # Set breakpoint at 0x400088a

./exp.py de ./pwn -t -b malloc -b free # Set 2 breakpoints
```

For programs with `PIE`, the way to set breakpoints is:

```shell
./exp.py de ./pwn -t -b b+0xafd # Set breakpoint at 0xafd

./exp.py de ./pwn -t -b malloc -b free -b b+0x101f # Set 3 breakpoints

./exp.py de ./pwn -t -b malloc+0x10 # Set breakpoint at malloc+0x10, first look for malloc symbol in libc, then look for malloc symbol in elf
```

To `hook` certain functions, such as `ptrace`:

```shell
./exp.py de ./pwn -H ptrace -H alarm:1   # Hook ptrace, default return 0; hook alarm, return value is 1

./exp.py de ./pwn -h ./hook.c # Specify after writing your own hook.c
```

When debugging with an `ubuntu` virtual machine with a desktop, you can choose to pop up a `gnome` window:

```shell
./exp.py de ./pwn -g -b 0x400088a # Set breakpoint at 0x400088a

./exp.py de ./pwn -g -s "directory /usr/glibc/glibc-2.31/malloc" # Specify source code debugging directory
```

After debugging the script, you need to attack remotely:

```
./exp.py re ./pwn 127.0.0.1:13337
```

# pwncli Main Command
Option descriptions:

- `flag` option: Enabling this option means turning it on, like `-a` in `ls -a` is a `flag` option
- Multiple choice: Can specify multiple values, like `-x y1 -x y2` can pass `y1` and `y2` to the `x` option
- Multiple usage methods: Like `-x --xxx --xxx-xx`, then using `-x` or `--xxx` or `--xxx-xxx` are all valid

The `pwncli` command is the main command. Entering `pwncli -h` will give you the following output:

```

The `debug` subcommand is the most commonly used subcommand and has the most parameters designed for it. The meaning and usage of each parameter will be explained in detail below.

**Arguments**:

```
FILENAME  Optional  Path to the local pwn file to debug, can also be set via the -f option in the pwncli main command; if not set in pwncli main command, it must be set here.
```

**Options**:

```
--argv  Optional      Arguments passed to the process constructor besides the file path.
-e      Optional      Set startup environment variables, e.g., LD_PRELOAD=./libc.so.6;PORT_ENV:1234,IP_ADDR=localhost, data will be passed to the env parameter of the process constructor. Environment variables will be uniformly converted to uppercase. LD_PRELOAD can be abbreviated as PRE=./libc.so.6.
-p      Optional      Flag option, effective after enabling gdb, off by default. When enabled, a getchar() function will be executed before the main function, facilitating gdb attach for debugging, avoiding the problem of gdb.attach failure sometimes. Essentially compiles and generates a .so file and sets it as the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, executing the getchar function in the init section.
-f      Optional      Effective after enabling gdb, your custom hook.c file, which will be compiled as .so and set as the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
-H      Optional      Multiple choice, effective after enabling gdb. Select function names to hook, such as alarm function, hooked functions will directly return 0, supports multiple options, i.e., -H alarm -H ptrace.
-t      Optional      Flag option, off by default. When enabled, uses tmux to open gdb with vertical split screen. Must ensure you're in a tmux environment before enabling, otherwise an error will occur.
-w      Optional      Flag option, off by default. When enabled, uses wsl mode to open gdb with pop-up window debugging. Must ensure you're in a wsl distribution environment before enabling, otherwise an error will occur.
-m      Optional      Effective after enabling gdb, default is auto. Specify the gdb debugging mode. auto: automatic selection; tmux: effective after enabling -t; wsl-b: effective after enabling -w, uses bash.exe pop-up; wsl-u: effective after enabling -w, uses ubuntu1x04.exe pop-up, provided it's added to the Windows host PATH environment variable; wsl-o: effective after enabling -w, uses open-wsl.exe pop-up, need to download from https://github.com/mskyaxl/wsl-terminal and add it to Windows PATH environment variable; wsl-wt: effective after enabling -w, uses windows-terminal pop-up, needs Windows Terminal installed; wsl-wts: effective after enabling -w, uses Windows Terminal split screen debugging, ensure version is at least 1.11.3471.0.
-u      Optional      Flag option, off by default. When enabled, will use gdb for debugging as much as possible.
-g      Optional      Effective after enabling gdb, default is auto. Select gdb plugin type. Prerequisites are having gef, peda, pwndbg all installed in home directory. auto: uses ~/.gdbinit configuration, otherwise uses pwncli/conf/.gdbinit-xxx configuration.
-b      Optional      Multiple choice, effective after enabling gdb. Set breakpoints in gdb. Three ways to set: 1) Function address, -b 0x401020 or -b 4198432; 2) Function name, -b malloc; 3) Offset relative to PIE base, suitable for PIE-enabled scenarios, -b base+0x4f0 or -b b+0x4f0 or -b \$rebase(0x4f0) or -b \$_base(0x4f0), only supports gef and pwndbg plugins. Supports setting multiple breakpoints, e.g., -b malloc -b 0x401020.
-s      Optional      Effective after enabling gdb. Can be file path or statement. If statement, will be executed in gdb after setting, each sub-statement separated by semicolon ;, e.g., -s "directory /usr/src/glibc/glibc-2.27/malloc;b malloc"; if file path, will execute each line in the file sequentially in gdb.
-n      Optional      Flag option, off by default. Set pwntools to no log information. If this option is enabled, pwntools log will be turned off.
-P      Optional      Flag option, off by default. Disable stop function. The stop function waits for input and prints current information, facilitating gdb debugging. After enabling this option, the stop function will be disabled.
-v      Optional      Flag option, off by default. When enabled, will show log information. If you need to show more information, you can enter -vv.
-h      Optional      View help.
```

## template Subcommand

This subcommand facilitates generating various exploitation template script files, including exploitation scripts using `pwncli`'s command line mode and script mode, as well as templates needed for using native `pwntools`. The templates define code related to local debugging and remote exploitation, and provide commonly used abbreviation functions like `sa/sla/r/rl`.

Entering `pwncli template -h` gives help information:

```
Usage: pwncli template [OPTIONS] [FILETYPE]

  FILETYPE: The type of exp file

  pwncli template cli
  pwncli template lib
  pwncli template pwn

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Where the `cli` type template uses `pwncli`'s script mode, the `lib` type template uses library mode, and the `pwn` type template directly uses raw `pwntools` to build without using `pwncli`.

# Dependencies

The dependency list for `pwncli` is as follows:

```
click   
ropper  
pwntools  
```
